//Middlewares - is a code block that is excecuted between user req til the req gets the server. morgan is used for obtaining the requests to ehe web page
//urlencoded is used for extracting the data in req.body."title" in routes
//multer is used for managing the uploading of files to the server. diskStorage provides full control on storing files. Destination and filename are available. Destination - where the file is stored, filename - the name of the file inside the folder, filename recieves four params: req, file, cd, filename, we are using cb(callback) and file, cb recieves two params, fisrt must be null and second we concatenate uuid (in order to diferrenciate the file from others) and path.extname(file.originalname) which returns the extension of the original file, getting as a result => uuid + extname.
